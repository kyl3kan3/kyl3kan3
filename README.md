# Alert Triage

A Vercel + Neon incident triage console built from the MVP blueprint in `BLUEPRINT.md`.

## Stack

- Next.js App Router
- Vercel deployment target
- Neon Postgres via `@neondatabase/serverless`
- Tailwind CSS

## Local setup

```bash
npm install
cp .env.example .env.local
npm run dev
```

Apply `db/schema.sql` to a Neon database, then set `DATABASE_URL` in `.env.local` and in Vercel project environment variables.

The app is build-safe without `DATABASE_URL`; it falls back to demo data until Neon is configured.

`INBOUND_WEBHOOK_SECRET` is optional during development. When set, inbound webhook calls must include either `Authorization: Bearer <secret>` or `x-webhook-secret: <secret>`.

## Functional surface

- Live Neon-backed dashboard metrics, ticket queue, team load, and incident stream.
- Manual ticket intake with priority, team, owner, reporter, and description fields.
- Ticket status, priority, team, and owner updates from the console.
- Ticket comments and timeline refresh.
- Inbound alert webhook that normalizes alert/email payloads, deduplicates incidents, creates or updates tickets, and records raw alerts.
